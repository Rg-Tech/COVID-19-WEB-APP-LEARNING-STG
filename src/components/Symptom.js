          <p>
            If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat
            nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family members,
            and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect
            frequently touched surfaces.

            Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy
            diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with loved ones
            through the phone or internet. Children need extra love and
            attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to regular
            routines and schedules as much as possible.
